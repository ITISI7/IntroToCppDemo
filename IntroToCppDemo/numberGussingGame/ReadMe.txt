Number gussing game

The player will think of a number and it will guess what number you are thinking

if it guess incorrectly it will ask if your number was higher. The player can type "y" for yes
and n for "no". If you type "y" the game will end and show how many guess it took, if typed "n"
it will ask if the number you are thinking is higher and will give you a number based of your
feedback
